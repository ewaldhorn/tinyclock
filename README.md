# Clock

Attempt at creating a sort of Clock in [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) and Wasm.

This is based on <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_animations>

The GitHub static page is available at <https://ewaldhorn.github.io/tinyclock/>

I think it's also available at <https://tinyclock-9359a9.gitlab.io/>

## Libraries
It makes use of [TinyCanvas](https://github.com/ewaldhorn/tinycanvas) and [Dommie](https://github.com/ewaldhorn/dommie) to make life easier.
